/* What to do?

In this task, you need to assign numbers to bus routes.

Namely, for each route specified by the set of stop names, 
you must either issue a new number (the first route - 1, the second - 2, etc.), 
     or 
return the number of the existing route that corresponds to such a set of stops.

The sets of stops received from each other by rearranging the stops are considered different
